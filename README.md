### TODO:

#### Refactoring

- [ ] Prefer classes over tuples (e.g. with animation's (TimeSpan, Texture) collection).

#### Bug fixing

- [ ] The grid cell size calculating is not working correctly when the game is scaled on the fullscreen.

#### New features

- [x] Make the Bimil.Engine as it's own project (use internals, etc).
- [x] Create better scene creation logic.
